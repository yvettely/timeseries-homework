# Time Series Homework

In this homework, I have applied the ARMA Model, to forecast returns, the ARIMA model, to forecast the settle price and the GARCH model to forecast volatility of the Dollar-Yen exchange using historical data.

I have also used the Linear Regression Model to make predictions using the testing data and have concluded that the out-of-sample data performed better than the in-sample data.
